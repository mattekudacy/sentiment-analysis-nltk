2018:comments: it gets worse and worse every year
We’ve officially reached the 4 year anniversary for this disaster
Lets be real, the real reason YouTube removed dislikes was because they couldn’t stand to see the video they made was and probably still is the most disliked video on the whole platform.
Back when a rewind was the biggest problem we had
It's been four years already? Man, time has flown by so fast these days. It's still one the most disliked videos on YouTube with over 20 million dislikes.
I'm 100 percent sure this is the reason the dislikes were removed
Will Smith: “It’s Rewind time”
Fun fact, this video and the one made in 2019 are single-handily the reason why they don't do rewinds anymore
Zero dislikes, 3.1 MILLION likes!? This video must be a masterpiece!
This makes me feel weirdly nostalgic. It’s a rare moment in history where all of humanity came together to hate on this awful video, together.
Respect to the 20,284,162 million who disliked it
disappointed but not surprised. :(
literally the best part of the video
This rewind has aged like milk.
For those who do not have the extension, this video has 20M dislikes as of April 21st, 2023. Let's keep it going!
I’m kinda sad they quit doing rewinds every year, why can’t we all just come to together at the end of every year to just laugh at a purposely bad video.
For those who are wondering this has over 20 million dislikes
what surprised me is that they didn't even manage to get in Rhett and Link who were in every Rewind since and even made a giant fundraiser in collaboration with youtube
The animators carry this whole thing
that sign aged amazingly

Alternate Universe: YOUTUBE REWIND 2018 IS NOW THE MOST LIKED VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!!
Ya know, we didn’t know how good we had it before the 2020s…
For the people in the future, This video currently has exactly  20,285,137 Dislikes.
YouTube : We could make the best YouTube Rewind this year.
If they truly wanted an 'Everyone controls rewind', they would have done several polls, looked at the comments in the polls, actually looked at the trending tabs, and listened to the feedback.
“There’s one thing this video needs…K-POP!” At that moment my last 5 brain cells started deteriorating faster than Amber Heard’s reputation.
People who disliked this video have all my respect
Truly one of the the Youtube videos ever created. Definitely a number out of a number.
3.1 million likes
I bet y’all when YouTube rewind 2019 comes out we’re all gonna click it then next then you know
This video must be a masterpiece with 3.1M likes and 0 dislikes!
People back in 2018 were mad because will smith was in this despite not being a youtuber
how is this video still getting disliked
can we just agree that even though this is hella cringe its kinda nostalgic looking back at it in 2022
20,295,891 dislikes remind me to update
Hey uh just was wondering if uh this is a out of season April fool's joke.....
Remember when we thought life couldn’t get worse than when this was created.
Ah yes, zero dislikes. Everyone definitely loves this video and it is one of YouTube’s best ever

Who came here after CS50 puzzle day?
¡Wow! ¡no hay dislikes! Este debe ser un video realmente bueno
congratulations
They
When Will Smith said “it’s rewind time” and rewind the year, that was literally the moment ever.
The fact that Odd1sout Got a role is just good
chatgpt made this comment
0 dislikes? This must be a masterpiece
this video currently has 20M dislikes
"We control rewind this year"
My favorite part was when he said "It's Rewind time" and then Rewinded all over the place. Truly one of the videos of all time.
wow this video seems great! 3.1m likes and counting. this is definitely the video of all time

Yeah this is probably why they removed dislikes
No way the video has 3.1 million likes with no dislikes, this must be a great video
for those interested May 2023 : 20.3 million dislikes
It would be ironic  if this video could get a copyright strike
This video is definitely one of the main reasons youtube removed the dislike button
I'm convinced that the reason 'YouTube' removed dislikes is because they don't want people to see how bad this was (in a different way)
YouTube is so Smart by hiding Dislikes!
Even though they removed the dislikes, this video will always be there to haunt them
3.1M likes, i’m gonna have a fun time watching this!
Eliminating dislikes is one of the worst ideas they have ever had, but it seems that for years they have been competing to do the wrong thing
Will Smiths part slapped so hard!!
Seeing them remake the idol MV makes me truly realize how cracked out it was
20297198 dislikes in total
No dislikes? It has to be good
Let’s all take a moment of silence for the 20,295,719 dislikes before they get removed
I want a refund
Even tho everybody thought this was bad, it’s nostalgic and kinda nice to watch back
lets be real
2017-2023 were the worst years ever.
Em 10 anos de Youtube eu nunca dei deslike em um vídeo, absolutamente NENHUM, este é o primeiro. Parabéns Youtube.
Welp it's at 20 million dislikes now
Youtube Rewind 2019
SO PROUD OF THIS COMUNITY

Youtube Rewind 2019
SO PROUD OF THIS COMUNITY
This video is actually nostalgic now. The good old times without any tiktok addiction, no negativity and etc.
is not really cringe for me, is kinda nostalgic
Truly a video. One of the videos of all time, there was an intro.. and an outdoor
"return youtube dislikes extention" OHOHOH Happy christmas
This video subverted my expectations, is way better than the rewind of 2019
The story time animators got done SO dirty
20 million dislikes in 2023.
the only reason this captured 2018 is because it captures the moment in history everyone bullied youtube until they stopped making rewinds
This is easy to look at compared to the cringe we are exposed to in 2019 and after
If there ain’t aliens in Rewind 2019 we storming YouTube HQ
de cierta forma, igual extraño los Rewind de youtube :(
Will Smith "Yaa It's Rewind Time"is perfect
For the future generations, this video had 20M dislikes in 2023.
idk why they stopped making these. In such tough times we need something wholesome like rewind (okay not 2018 one though).
people are still coming back to remember the disaster
Wow this is such a great video with 3.1 million likes. The community must have really liked this video!
2018 was the cringiest year
este rewind no estuvo mal (ignorando la parte de los periodistas bailando bailes de fortnite)

“Let’s give the people what they want”
El rewind que termino todo, Creo que los anteriores fueron mejores que este último; pero  la idea de YouTube era muy buena. Esto ocasionó que cualquier realizará uno rewind en donde solo aparecieron los cuates y está chido pero me incómoda un poco que lo llamen YouTube Rewind Hispano que mejor se debería llamar Rewind de mis cuates.
Wow, What a great video! Totally doesn't have 20M dislikes
YouTube's youtube channel has the most disliked video on YouTube
Coming back to this video in a weird form of nostalgia
This is why YouTube removed dislikes.
Hey, YouTube! Buddy! How about you actually READ the comments this year. Just a friendly tip ;)
Will Smith’s part HITS hard. No, literally, after what happened at the Oscar’s, I can tell you, Will Smith’s part HITS hard.
The best part is when will smith said "it's rewind time!" and rewinded all over the place. Truly one of the videos ever made.
20 million dislikes, yikes
It feels like there are no dislikes anymore
Raise your hand if CS50 Puzzle Day sent you here.
I thought last years was bad
YouTube, every year you make it worse. Thanks for making us such a fun thing to watch.
It’s so funny how much funneh grew since 2018-2022 it’s so sad

People of the future: this has 3M likes, 19M dislikes. Never forget
its impossible to not cringe
Will Smith
20M Lets Go!!!! 2023
honestly looking back this isn't really that bad
The best part of this whole entire thing was
Youtube:
This video will always be iconic, idc what anyone says
the energy of this video is carried on in that regal ad that plays before every movie (you know the one)
This video is the reason dislikes got removed
This Was Truly The L Of All Time
Truly the video of all time
i came with low expectations, still left disappointed, wtf was this
you think this is extremley cringe until you realise that we're the ones who all did this
The fact that this won't happen again makes me sad

Don’t cry because it happened, smile because it’s over
theres 20,288,608 dislikes and counting for y'all who don't have the dislikes add on
“I think we should read the comments” HAHAHAHAHA lol the irony
this was so goofy
Indonesia's first entry into YouTube rewind🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Wow 3.1 million likes and 0 dislikes? This must be an incredible video
Only good thing about this rewind is that they decided to put the animators in the actual video, instead of in the after credits
This is the reason YouTube disabled dislikes
"I think... We should read the comments"
If this was named Internet Rewind 2018 it would have a MUCH BETTER REPUTATION
wow! Zero dislikes! This must be an amazing video
when they knew it was so bad they removed dislikes
This slaps harder than the Academy awards ceremony
as of 2023 it has 20.2 million dislikes
We all know why dislikes got removed, we'll never forget.
jokes aside, damn 2018 was a great year
This is the greatest video ever! It has no dislikes!!!!! WOWWOWOWOWOW
Ok but why wasn't it tat bad to watch

Re watching this, it isn’t that bad to be honest
YouTube gonna break there own record with the most disliked video on YouTube
Lets be honest: Jaiden had the best part in this. Thanks, Jaiden!! :)
Damn! That intro absolutely slaps!!
For future generations - this videos has 20 millions dislikes in May 2023.
Kudos to the editors and VFX animators of this video.
We all hate YouTube for removing dislikes.
“lets give the people what they want”
This hits hard
The fact this is nostalgic now really shows how much we aged
20,300,986 dislikes (updating this comment every now and then.
As embarrassing as this must be for YouTube to look back on, deleting it would only mean that YouTube would have to admit it even existed.

for the people who can't see dislikes, it's now at 20m
here before 4 million dislikes
This is the biggest collaboration ever.
watching this in 2023 makes it like absolutely nostalgic, this rewind literally made a mark in our existence (in a HAHAHA way)
literally 1984
God So loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
this is not that bad
welp that sucked lmao

YouTube Rewind 2018 is just a big meme
I don’t know who most of these people or references are
wow no dislikes, what a masterpiece
All jokes aside, this was one of Youtube's rewinds of all time
Behold, the death of YouTube
even if its very cringe, its very nostalgic as well
someone had to approve this
2019 : Comments are disabled for this video

Let's take a minute to appreciate why they had a lot of dislikes but this is pretty much overall okay It's not bad stop hating it

Viejos tiempos
bro got 20M dislikes and 3.1M likes
And we thought last year was bad
Just think about this for a moment. Youtube- the literal platform this is on, who should know everything about making a good video- made the most disliked video of all time. That's mad.
Zero dislikes, 3.1 MILLION likes!? This video must be a masterpiece!
They tried the best they could to make us forget, but we still remember
Thank you bus driver
Let's take a moment to push all of our agendas
20 million dislikes yeah
There’s only like 7 relevant people this year
you know, this is the best YouTube rewind in the last 5 years.
This was the certified nation of YouTube rewind
Cringe.. sorry.
This was actually amazing

Current rewind: 16 Million dislikes
Ah yes, the 2018 rewind,
Rest in peace, world record holder

this has 20 million dislikes in 2023
Youtube: I know what everyone wants.
I'm wacthing this four years later and realizinghow cringe the world really was.
Let's admit it we miss YouTube rewinds even this one although it's cringe because we got so many memes out of it

Unpopular opinion: It isn’t actually that bad
20M dislikes now
You guys didnt make the comment section come true
Rewind 2018 was so good that only 3 million people remembered to like it!
“baaah, it’s rewind time”
2018: people came to see the rewind
Loved the part when Will Smith said " its rewind time " and then he started rewinding all over Youtube Rewind 2018
Wow, 20.2M dislikes-
“We should read the comments”
The best part was when Will Smith said "IT'S REWIND TIME" and he rewound all over those guys
Viendo los otros rewinds y este te das cuenta que era mejor porque nadie hablaba solo fluía xd
20 Million Dislikes

20m dislikes lol
They kept teasing giving people what they want then no pewdiepie
Jaiden's part is the only good part.  Just such a clean animation!
3 million likes must be an amazing video.
Y’all we can do whatever we want
this rewind was like a slap in the face!
We can’t see how many dislikes it has now
Where's Thanos when you need him
Love how the post replayed part of this whole video was jadien's pewdiepie reference
Great video! No one dislikes this!
PewDiePie's rewind is much better
Honestly it’s pretty good it’s just hated so much cus it’s maybe a little to corporate.
20M dislikes
" I think.. We should read the comments"
just the fact that this is the most disliked video, and that it's also made by YOUTUBE ITSELF is just crazy.
Who agrees that the animations were the best part of the recap?
Everyone who disliked this video please remove it so we get dislikes back
The only thing that is not cringe in this is big shaq. It’s sad he only said one thing

Youtube Community: 16M dislikes
Oh wow! 3 million likes and NO DISLIKES! This must be the best video ever
I’m amazed at how they manage to make me cringe for the entire vid - yt have done a great job , well done!!
20M dislikes now
So sad the try guys were in this years rewind. Still, we need rewind back.
For the people who didn't install (Youtube Dislikes)
Plot Twist: The people that were in rewind disliked the video
Honestly the editing and VFX were top tier it was just the storyline that made no sense. Compared to the 2019 rewind this was better
The dedication to get 20 million dislikes is insane. Respect.
this rewind was the worst and last
This video has 3.1 million likes and no dislikes! This video must be a masterpiece...
20 million dislikes, LOLOL
I came into this with no expectations and was still disappointed
They litterly gave the commynity all they didnt want
Gotta give them some credit for the dog, lipstick, marshmello
The decline of Youtube.
best part
20m dislikes and counting
“Baby” by Justin Bieber: Looks like I’m the most disliked video ytb
ngl the best part could have been the animations but they just made them dance and awkwardly sing

Political messages and too much talking, 2018 was full of memes and unforgettable moments that weren’t even shown here
This is so GOOOD!
that part makes me cringe every time
That part with the animators was hilarious
This wasn’t even that bad looking back. I’m so sad it’s gone.
3,1M likes
This is so beautiful it made think how great the year 2018 was good and it brought me so many memories of so many YouTubers and artists accomplishing their dreams and that their never alone...
20m dislikes and counting, oh boy. Good thing there are extentions to bring dislikes back.
I love how most topics and people in this aren’t even relevant anymore
Looking back at our culture back in 2018, times were so different compared to now.
The amasing thing is that untill the capfire it's actually pretty good
This gets worse every time you come back
This isn't as bad as people make it seems like.
every year this video get worse.
Imagine creating something on your own software that everyone hated and then being so embarrassed you decide to hide people's opinions.
WE MAKIN IT OUT OF THE HOOD WITH THIS ONE
Why does this have 20 mil dislikes? Honestly, it’s not that bad, they actually tried. This is the reason they gave up in 2019, the negative feedback. Even the community back then was better. Now all we have is toxic people who argue and insult each other for having an opinion. Good days, they were
20M dislikes XD
А ведь раньше нашей проблемой был всего лишь то плохой YouTube rewind... Я бы хотел вернуться в 2018, тогда было лучше...

20M NOW!
they literally skipped all the actually relevant stuff that happened this year
It’s a shame. Everyone coming back year after year to hate on this video is just ensuring another rewind never gets made.
Watching this rewind 4 years later makes me think that this video wasn't that bad, it was even cool. The only problem is when you see who created the video... Bro come on, feels like they've just spent like 100$ for this thing
20M de deslikes, que desastre
It’s not the thing they did with this rewind that made it bad, it’s the horrible ideas everyone had for controlling it.
For future generations, this video had 20 million dislikes in 2023
I feel uncomfortable
0 dislikes? Damn this must be a really good rewind. Makes me question why they cancelled rewind forever
What an amazing video 3.1 million like and NO DISLIKES? wow this must be an amazing masterpiece of a video!
No idea what "rewind" is, but this video now is WAYYY past 20 million dislikes
Honestly, it isn't that bad. It tells a story, it's wholesome
20M dislikes lmao
YouTube rewind 2019 comes out
The fact this came out the same year as mickey mouses 90th birthday is shocking
Wow this is a great video! 3 mil likes!
LETS GO FOUR YEARS LATER 20 MILLION DISLIKESSS
Looking back, this seems like something Vought would make.
and thats how you get 20 million dislikes
20M dislikes lmao

This was the best rewind of all time
Yo when ned was still a try guy
20,300,191 dislikes at this time
There is nothing wrong with this video in my opinion. No wonder YouTube stopped these rewinds. It was actually good!
I like how YouTube themselves made the most disliked video on there own platform
This is so nastalgiac
Moist himself said no to being in this. He dodged the world's largest bullet
The last clip was the only good thing in this rewind
Ok, lets be honest, the animator segment was amazing, and jaidens thing was hilarious
all these dislikes were for nothing
If I were to work in Youtube, I would question who these people even are.
10/10 best YouTube rewind ever
10/10 best YouTube rewind ever
It's a tradition come back and remember why this had that record
This is so bad
Viéndolo en 2023 y lo miro hasta peor de lo que pensaba
Its almost been 5 years and its even more cringy than it was before
The irony is that YouTube created the most disliked video on YouTube. Can't get enough of that.
やっぱこの頃のFortniteの勢いすごかったよなw
Ahhh what a nice video, it has 3.1 million likes, that must mean people loved it
AY
The memory of those who still stand will never be whipped, as long as YouTube exists, us subs and tubers will never let them forget the billion of dislikes this video had!
Dang over 6x the dislikes than likes, and they probably grew a lot but we just cant see them
The only thing that was good was the recognition for that calculus teacher. Legit though he teaches me more in a few minutes than what my teacher teaches me in a month
The last good YouTube rewind was 2014 and before that everything after was straight garbaggggeeeee
Ahhh, 2018 back when life was peak, Back when fortnite was a good game and you'd get excited on a saturday morning to hop on with your friends and play all day having actual fun
20 million dislikes
20 million dislikes
Kaiden just hitting the jig tho
BaAh
I didnt know youtube had over 2,5 million employees
Luzu, Julio profe y james (el mono blanco del challenhe de bailar) lo único que me gusto del rewind
NOSTALGIA IS REAL
the only good things were the animators who donated their braincells for this video
Youtube said they removed dislikes to "protect small creators".
2023 update: this video has 20 million dislikes
Can’t even see the video has 19 million dislikes anymore. Smh
Y pensar que un chico hace mejores rewind que el mismísimo YouTube
It’s great that the animator community finally is show to be a great part of yt

Iol
the fact 2 of my favorite animators tried to do the kpop while another animator was just traumatized holding the signs is actually pretty funny
no comment
The only Youtuber who can get the most disliked video is YouTube themselves
Actually this video is not THAT bad, the music is great and funny, even if it’s not what everyone likes it is very 2018-trends-like, the only thing annoying is the blah-blah-thank you to everyone-blah-love everybody-blah part
los patrones
20 MILLION dislikes , WOW!
Omg this video must be a masterpiece with no dislikes and 3.1 mill likes
oh no
"If pewds isn't in yt rewind 2019"
Maturing is realizing that YouTube rewind never really mattered and this is better than what we have now called recap or something.
Thsi needs to be put in the History Books so that we don't repeat our mistakes.
To be honest, this is the reason youtube got rid of dislikes
Going back to this it was actually fun days didn't deserve all that hate .
Nah not the baby shark at the end
2017: 2.2 million dislikes
Lo veo de nuevo y no esta taaan mal eh, si tiene sus cositas buenas
At least this is no longer the most embarrassing thing Will Smith has done.
Agradezco a este Rewind, me permitió conocer a Bangtan.
20 million dislikes now
This is the last thing you see before you're dragged to Hell in a Fortnite Battlebus.
This will always be iconic.
Yeah this is nostalgic

My favorite part of YouTube rewind was when Will Smith said "it's rewind time"
This is amazing love it
20,294,245 dislikes and counting,
aaaaa nostalgia
update: 20,294,186 dislikes
"There's something this video needs..."
It was almost if not impossible for a YouTube video to get 20m likes, let alone dislikes in less than a billion views, but it's only impossible until it happens
The cringe this video has is absolutely hilarious
que saldades desse ano
Yeah, this was not what we wanted
I thought they were hyping up pewdiepie but nO-
wow, no dislikes! this video is so cool guys totally
If im being honest this was my favorite rewind
Who remember the 19M dislikes in 2021???
was the best part!
This is pretty cringe
Damn every year it gets trashier
Me after seeing they included Casey: LETS GOO!!
It's actually not that bad tbh why people disliked this rewind tho
Everyone who disliked: I’m doing my part!

WOW, no dislikes!   That’s amazing it must be the first video ever to have no dislikes and 240 million views!
im probably the only one who thought this was ok
I just keep coming here to read the comments and dislikes. Anyone else?
What’s sad is that most of those primitive building videos are fake, but a lot of people don’t know that.
We want to revive the 20 million people who shared their voices as said in this video who “shared their voices”
3.1M likes and 20M dislikes as of 4/29/23
Damn. This video has 3.1 million likes and no dislikes! Must be a great video : D
you did not give what the people want
“Let’s give the viewers what they want”
Truly one of the videos of all time
This the equivalent of your parents buying you a present based in what they consider is cool for you.
Im using a W extinction to see dislikes, there are 20 M dislikes W

You will never outlive this.
Why this vídeo got tons of dislikes?
For those curious this video has roughly 3.1 million likes and 20 million dislikes
This video was just a Fortnite reference and the fact that they were so out of touch just solidified this and 2019 as the worst rewinds of all time.
It'd be such a shame for this to have 20M dislikes.
BAAAHHHH. its rewind time.
Coming back to this video honestly hands down best part is Jaiden Animations part.
20M dislikes. return yt dislikes google extension. get rolled yt
Twitch has joined chat.
That opening scene hits different. Literally.
The animators were the best part cant disagree.
Stop hiding the dislikes its ok YouTube..
Opinion: Best part about this whole thing was the animators getting a spotlight, the rest is garbage
20 million dislikes
The depressing part is that I KNOW next year is going to be even more cringy.
It’s just not as iconic without dislikes smh
Remember when everyone loved Will Smith?
And the awards for
Me looking at everybodys outfit
Looking back at it, this video wasnt that bad
No Pewdiepie saying "YEAR REVIEW"
“Let’s give the people what they want” It’s just stupid how much they emphasize that
The fact that this still has a better view/like video than 2021 rewind it insane
Come on YT, show me the dislikes.
2022 and this still doesn't get old
YouTube rewind videos are specialties of 2010s
"This video keeps growing everyday"
20 million dislikes is legendary. Probably the video that made the most people actually care about Youtube Rewind

There is just nothing to be said.
currently it is 20M dislikes in april 2023
From America to Ireland, the dislike button was a poor soul taken by Youtube on their rampage to become friendly to new creators.
2023: 20M dislikes
If YT was really like this I would never visit this site
This video was so great that those 19 million people finally realised they were wrong and removed thier own dislike by themselves .... healing is a  real thing people
this video is so epic that it has 3.1M likes and zero dislikes maybe this video really did well
3 m likes, and 20 m dislikes
Congrats on 19 mil! Way to quit while you’re ahead!

Why do people hate it anyways?
I feel like this is what old people think the internet is like.
What a masterpiece it got 0 dislike!
To be honest it's still better than jellybean's content.
20M dislikes lol
When he said "it's rewind time" that made me happy
was that itsfunneh and gaming with kev?!
Well, That was alienating and strangely lethargic.
Still cool on the many creators working on this.
They were so embarrassed that their own video was the most disliked video they hid the dislikes. One of the worst decisions they ever made
23-Apr-23
It brings it all back:) miss it the year of only good memories
YAAAAAEH
This is not a rewind. It's a cringefest.
ok, but the guy making the playbutton out of clay at the end was pretty cool ngl
The only part where it's ACTUALLY good, is when the Animators come in.
Still disliking this in 2023 lets gooooo
This video must be so great it has so much positive likes!

Fun fact : this is why youtube hide dislikes
Let's play this video at area 51 a few times so the guards leave.
This is one of the few rare cases where something is so bad that it’s hilarious
Watching this 4 years later hits different
20M dislikes
Man, this video is great! Not a single person disliked it even!!!
Worst rewind
Lol bet Willsmith wishes he had a rewind now.
This video felt like a slap in the face, especially the opening.
My favorite part of this video is JaidenAnimation part
voy a amar a youtube rewind les invito a todos a youtube rewind a dar 3,139,861 M
20 MILLONES DE DISLIKES
